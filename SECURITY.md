# Reporting Security Issues

I take security bugs seriously. I appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings.

Report security bugs in third-party modules to the person or team maintaining the module. You can also report a vulnerability through the [npm contact form](https://www.npmjs.com/support) by selecting "I'm reporting a security vulnerability".
